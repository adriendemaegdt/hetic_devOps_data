# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI/CD data

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
